=============================

This is an implementation of a named entity recognizer that uses Graph
Convolutional Networks.

Test NER
--------
Execute the file
```python
python3 test_ner.py
```


Train NER
---------
You will need to put your 'train.conll' into the 'data/' directory,
then execute the file
```python
python3 train.py
```
